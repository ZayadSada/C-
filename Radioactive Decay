/* This program computes the amount of a radioactive substance 

remaining after an initial amount decays for some time period.

 Written by zayad sada  -- Project  -- jun. 24, 2024

 Input: element's name, its half-life, the initial amount, 

and a time period

 Output: the input items and the amount of the substance 

remaining at the end of the time period
